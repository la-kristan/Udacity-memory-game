Match the cards to win the game!

If you complete the game in 16 moves (clicking two cards counts as one move), you get a score of three stars! 24 moves or less gets you a score of two stars, and more than 24 results in a one-star score. Pay attention to the cards, to complete the game in as few moves as you can! Have fun!

The design is from the starter files provided by Udacity, though I do want to make a more unique (and responsive!) version in the next few months. The JS code (except for the shuffle function, as noted in the code comments) is my own... not the most elegant or efficient code ever, but hopefully that will be improved in later versions. Special thanks to Matthew Cranford for his guidance on how to make a timer.
